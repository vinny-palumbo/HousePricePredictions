# House Price Predictions

In this project, I've built a Decision Tree model that predicts House Prices. The model has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.

## Data

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. 

For each data point (neighborhood):
- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.
- `'MEDV'` is the median house value in the neighborhood.

## Environment

Here is my [environment file](https://github.com/vinny-palumbo/HousePricePredictions/blob/master/environment.yaml). To clone my environment execute: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
