# House Price Predictions



In this project, I've built a Decision Tree model that predicts House Prices. The model has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.



## Data



The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. 



For each data point (neighborhood):

- CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
- ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT    % lower status of the population
- MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
